This is a todo list app I am making to practice the following skills:

  -Devise for user auth.

  -Turbo / Stimulus for SPA functionality and generally cut down on page refreshes

  -Sending emails with ActionMailer


Anyone can view todo lists that are set to 'public' but to make a todo list the user must register and login

Once logged in a user can perform any CRUD related tasks on their lists.
